# Building an Educational Inference Engine: A 20-Part Journey

This is an educational inference engine built to demonstrate modern LLM serving techniques inspired by systems like vLLM.

Throughout the series, we’ll mirror production-grade ideas such as PagedAttention for KV-cache memory management and continuous (iteration-level) batching, popularized by vLLM — while keeping the code approachable and educational.

We’ll implement key components where appropriate and use “off-the-shelf” tools elsewhere. This isn’t meant to be a rigorous scientific deep dive, but it includes enough substance to teach the fundamentals and serve as a launch point for deeper exploration.

The implementation uses the Transformers library and is designed for learning, not production scale. Real systems like vLLM use custom CUDA kernels and advanced GPU I/O optimizations. This project prioritizes clarity over raw throughput; production-grade engines (e.g., vLLM + FlashAttention) rely on heavy CUDA optimization that we deliberately omit here.

This is also a work in progress — a living project where I intend to validate, verify, and apply scientific rigor as I go. I’m learning alongside you. Join me on the journey.

## Code Organization

The series follows the actual codebase structure:
- `ruvoninference/model/` - Core model and generation logic
- `ruvoninference/api/` - HTTP server and queue management
- `ruvoninference/sampling/` - Sampling strategies and utilities
- `commands/` - CLI implementations for each feature

## Key Principles

Throughout this series, we maintain several key principles:

1. **Educational First**: Every optimization is explained with clear reasoning
2. **Incremental Complexity**: New concepts build on established foundations
3. **Real Implementation**: All code examples come from the actual working system
4. **Honest Limitations**: We're clear about what's educational vs production-ready
5. **Practical Focus**: Each part delivers working, demonstrable functionality

## How to Read

Each article follows a consistent structure:
- **Problem Statement**: What challenge are we solving?
- **Solution Approach**: How do we tackle it?
- **Implementation Details**: The actual code and architecture
- **Performance Impact**: Measurable improvements (where applicable)
- **Key Takeaways**: Essential lessons learned

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** and set up the environment
2. **Start with [Part 1](part1-article.md)** to understand the foundation
3. **Follow along with the code** - each article references specific files
4. **Experiment with the CLI** - try the commands as you read
5. **Check out the advanced articles** for deeper understanding
