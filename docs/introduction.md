# Building an Educational Inference Engine: A 20-Part Journey

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation series for **RuvonVLLM** - an educational inference engine built from scratch to demonstrate modern LLM serving techniques inspired by systems like vLLM.

## About This Series

This 20-part series takes you from zero to a production-ready inference engine, building up concepts step by step. Each part focuses on a specific optimization or capability, with detailed explanations of both the "why" and the "how."

**Important Note**: This is an educational implementation using the transformers library, designed for learning rather than production scale. Real systems like vLLM use custom CUDA kernels and more advanced optimizations.

**Personal Note**: This series also serves as a teaching tool for me (Nicholas) as I learn about LLM inference systems. Each article represents my journey of understanding these concepts deeply enough to explain them clearly. If you're learning alongside me, you're in good company!

## Learning Path

### For Beginners
Start with Part 1 and follow sequentially. Each part builds on the previous ones, introducing concepts gradually.

### For Experienced Developers
You can jump to specific parts based on your interests:
- **API Development**: Parts 4, 6
- **Performance Optimization**: Parts 3, 7, 8
- **Theoretical Deep Dives**: Advanced articles

### For System Architects
Focus on the architectural decisions:
- **Part 6**: Queue strategies and design patterns
- **Part 7**: Static batching trade-offs
- **Part 8**: Dynamic request management

## Code Organization

The series follows the actual codebase structure:
- `ruvonvllm/model/` - Core model and generation logic
- `ruvonvllm/api/` - HTTP server and queue management
- `ruvonvllm/sampling/` - Sampling strategies and utilities
- `commands/` - CLI implementations for each feature

## Key Principles

Throughout this series, we maintain several key principles:

1. **Educational First**: Every optimization is explained with clear reasoning
2. **Incremental Complexity**: New concepts build on established foundations
3. **Real Implementation**: All code examples come from the actual working system
4. **Honest Limitations**: We're clear about what's educational vs production-ready
5. **Practical Focus**: Each part delivers working, demonstrable functionality

## How to Read

Each article follows a consistent structure:
- **Problem Statement**: What challenge are we solving?
- **Solution Approach**: How do we tackle it?
- **Implementation Details**: The actual code and architecture
- **Performance Impact**: Measurable improvements (where applicable)
- **Key Takeaways**: Essential lessons learned

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** and set up the environment
2. **Start with [Part 1](part1-article.md)** to understand the foundation
3. **Follow along with the code** - each article references specific files
4. **Experiment with the CLI** - try the commands as you read
5. **Check out the advanced articles** for deeper understanding
